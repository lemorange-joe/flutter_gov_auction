## FlutterConfig Environment Variables

### iOS

When deploying the app to iOS devices, the _ios/.envfile_ file **MUST** be updated to specify the required env file. The text should be put into the _ios/.envfile_ file according to the following modes:
Debug mode (in Visual Studio Code)

> .env.dev

Release mode (flutter run --release)

> .env.prod

### Android

When debugging or building release for Android, the corresponding env file will be included automatically as below:
Debug mode (in Visual Studio Code): _.env.dev_
Release mode (flutter run --release): _.env.prod_

Unlike iOS, there is no need to change any files/settings to load the required env file.

# Tips

## 1. To generate launcher icons
